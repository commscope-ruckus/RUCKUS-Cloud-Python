# examples.py uses the module rc_new_api.py to import several API calls using JWT and the new API endpoints.

# rc_new_api.py contains several API calls using JWT. It includes a function to detect if an API call is async, and if so, it uses the requestId to check the API call execution status.

To manage delegated accounts you need to add a new request header to the API call with a key named x-rks-tenantid, and the value as the tenantId for the delegated account. The function getVenues implements that.
